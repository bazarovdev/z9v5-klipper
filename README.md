# Klipper profile for Z9V5Pro-MK4 (with non mixing E4 extruder)

Forked from: https://github.com/Z9V5PRO/Z9V5Pro-MK4-Klipper
In addition, found this: https://github.com/Nathan22211/Z9V5-mixing-klipper

## Printer overview
The covers are hold by 4 screws each:
* Top contains stepper motors of extruders and connectors to printing head:
![Top of the printer](resources/undercover-top.jpg)
* Bottom contains the main board:
![Bottom of the printer](resources/undercover-bottom.jpg)
* Zoom in:
![Board Image](resources/board.jpg)

The board is `ZM3E4 V2.1`:
* Schematics and parts placement were found in [Zonestar3D GitHub](https://github.com/ZONESTAR3D/Control-Board/tree/main/32bit/ZM3E4/ZM3E4V21)
* In schematics, it is `STM32F103VCT6`, but on board, it is clone `APM32 F103VET6` by [Geehy](https://global.geehy.com/product/fifth/APM32F103)

## Klipper Flashing procedure
1. Obtain Klipper by clonning it: [klipper3D](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper)
1. Configure by going to cloned folder in terminal and run
    ```
    make menuconfig
    ```
    in menu choose:
    * MCU Architecture - STM32
    * Processor model - STM32F103
    * Bootloader offset - 20KiB bootloader
    * Communication interface (USB(on PA11/PA12))
    and press `Q` and `Y` to save and exit
1. Build FW file by running:
    ```
    make
    ```
    it should complete without errors (otherwise install dependencies till it works).
    You will get `klipper.bin` in `./out/` folder.
1. Prepairing uSD-Card:
    1. Copy the `klipper.bin` to root of uSD-Card and rename it to `firmware.bin` 
    1. remove `old_fw.bin` if exists
    1. Unmount (eject) uSD-Card to cause `fsync`
1. Flashing printer:
    1. Power off power supply (PSU) of the printer
    1. Insert uSD-Card
    1. Power on PSU
    1. Press and hold for few sec small power button on bottom main board cover (the Zonestar logo might blink few times but will stay dark after it).

In my case, the printer wasn't found and power cycle didn't help. Looking on Linux logs using `journalctl -f` showed that it had USB detection errors and it was solved by eliminating USB-hub and plugging-in printer directly into PC:
Errors via hub:

## Changes from original:
1. Z-sensor wasn't mapped so added:
    ```
    [probe]
    pin: !PB13
    ...
    ```
2. Fixed bed dimensions
    * due to wiring Y axis getting stuck into motor connector and so Y movement limited by 300mm (bed is 310mm)
    * screw locations also fixed and added delta of z-sensor position (for some reason it doesn't get compensated automatically)
3. Calibrated `rotation_distance` for all 4 extruders

## Heaters PID calibrations
To calibrate both PID loops of heaters used:
```
    PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=200
    SAVE_CONFIG
    restart
    PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60
    SAVE_CONFIG
    restart
```
results:
![graphs of temperatures](/resources/heaters_calib.png)

## Bed Mesh
Created initial bed mesh before fixing anything using GUI `HEIGHTMAP` clicking `CALIBRATE` and then running `SAVE_CONFIG` in console
result:
![initial bed mesh](/resources/initial_bed.png)

After that used
```
SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE
```
to adjust screws and bring all corner to the same plane, and running mesh again:
![final result](/resources/final_bed.png)

Interestingly, I added plastic rectangle below PEI flexible top and the mesh didn't change, then added metallic ruler and the sensor was triggered even before going down. It means, that the sensor measures metal plate/magnetic sticker and not real bed position. Hopefully, switching to steel PEI plate will solve the issue. 
Another option is to switch to BLTouch sensor that uses mechanical contact instead of inductive proximity sensor.

## Extrusion speed
Repeating experiment from this video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xRtypDjNvI
![extrusion of 300mm at various speeds](/resources/extrusion_300mm.png)

|F [mm/min] | E300mm [gr]|
|---|---|
|100|0.82|
|200|0.81|
|250|0.79|
|300|0.74|
|300|0.71|
|400|0.63|
|500|0.5|

![Graph of weight vs speed](/resources/extrusion_weight_graph.png)

So it seems that printing above `F200` starts extrude less material.

The `200mm/min` of `1.75mm` filament is equal `8.0176 mm^3/s`
```
200/60*(1.75/2)^2*pi = 8.0176 mm^3/s
```

Later tried to increase tension between gears and filament using adjustment screw and the results:

|F [mm/min] | E300mm [gr]|
|---|---|
|300|0.79|
|400|0.70|

So `300mm/min` seems ok:
```
300/60*(1.75/2)^2*pi = 12.026 mm^3/s
```
